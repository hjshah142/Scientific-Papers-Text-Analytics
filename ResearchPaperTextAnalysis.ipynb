Since the twentieth century, from the vacuum tube to the very\\n\\nlarge-scale integration circuit, the inorganic semiconductors have been developed rap-\\n\\nidly and applied in all aspects of human life. However, conventional optoelectronic\\n\\ncomponents using inorganic semiconductors are built on the rigid substrates and re-\\n\\nquire complex processing technique with high energy consumption, which gradually\\n\\nbecome unfavored in the present energy-constrained world.

And they have achieved remarkable progress since the\\n\\ndiscovery of conducting polymers by Heeger, MacDiarmid and Shirakawa in 1977 [2]\\n\\nand the pioneering work of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) by Tang and Van\\n\\nSlyke in 1987 [3]. To date, the optoelectronic devices based on organic materials have\\n\\nbeen successfully applied in the fields of electronics [4], nonlinear optics [5], displays\\n\\n[3], solar cells [6], sensors [7], storage [8], and so forth.\\n\\nIn order to realize a further breakthrough, developing efficient organic lumino-\\n\\ngens plays a key role for the fabrication of the high-performance optoelectronic de-\\n\\nvices such as OLEDs, electrofluorochromic (EFC) devices, luminescent solar\\n\\nconcentrators (LSCs) and liquid crystal display (LCDs). Many conventional lumi-\\n\\nnescent materials emit brightly in solutions but experience serious quenching prob-\\n\\nlem in the aggregated state or solid phase, which is referred to aggregation-caused\\n\\nquenching (ACQ). The ubiquitous ACQ effect has impeded the progress of many\\n\\noptoelectronic devices, in which organic luminogens are usually used as solid thin\\n\\nfilms. To mitigate the ACQ problem, various chemical, physical and/or engineering\\n\\nmethods have been proposed but often end with little effect. In 2001, an interest-\\n\\ning photophysical concept of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) was reported [9],\\n\\nwhich has changed the ways of thinking for luminescent materials researches. The\\n\\nemissions of AIE luminogens (AIEgens) can be brightened upon aggregate forma-\\n\\ntion, which is essentially opposite to the ACQ effect. Based on the experimental in-\\n\\nvestigation and theoretical calculation, the restriction of intramolecular motion\\n\\n(RIM), including rotation, vibration, twisting, etc., has been rationalized as the\\n\\nmain mechanism of the AIE phenomenon [10]. In solution, the active intramolecu-\\n\\nlar motions of AIEgens provide a nonradiative decay channel to dissipate excited\\n\\nstate energy, resulting in very low or null emission. When these motions are\\n\\nrestricted by weak intermolecular interactions or physical constraint in the aggre-\\n\\ngated state, the nonradiative decay channels are blocked and the radiative relaxation\\n\\nis promoted. Therefore, the excited state energy can be released as photons, rendering\\n\\ngreatly enhanced emission. In some cases, J-aggregate formation, twisted intramolecular\\n\\ncharge transfer (TICT), excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), etc. also\\n\\ncontribute to the AIE effect [11]. Attracted by the unique advantages of highly efficient\\n\\nsolid-state emissions of AIEgens, a great many of functional materials with AIE character-\\n\\nistics have been developed [12, 13] and successfully used in organic optoelectronic devices\\n\\n[14], biological sensors [15], chemical probes [16], and molecular electronics [17]. In this\\n\\nreview, we summarize representative advancements of AIEgens for the applications in\\n\\nOLEDs, EFC, LSC and LCD. The design strategies and working mechanisms of AIEgens\\n\\nfor the organic optoelectronic devices are analyzed in detail. From the future perspective,\\n\\nAIEgens will broaden the range of application fields and play an increasingly important\\n\\nrole in high-tech devices.\\nAIEgens for organic light-emitting diodes\\n\\nOLEDs have become one kind of the most competitive candidates for future high-\\n\\nresolution flexible display and illumination technologies, owing to the distinct merits of\\n\\n\\n\\nYu et al. PhotoniX            (2020) 1:11 Page 3 of 33\\nhigh contrast ratio, fast response, wide viewing angle, flexibility, light-weight, and so\\n\\non. OLEDs are thin-film devices consisting of the hole-transporting layer (HTL),\\n\\nelectron-transporting layer (ETL), emissive layer (EML), etc., sandwiched between two\\n\\nelectrodes. The conversion of electrical current into light takes place in OLEDs by ra-\\n\\ndiative recombination of excitons. A key parameter of OLED performance, external\\n\\nquantum efficiency (EQE), is the ratio of the number of emitted photons outside the\\n\\ndevice to the number of injected charges. The theoretical EQE can be estimated as a\\n\\nproduct of four factors, as illustrated in Eq. (1):\\n\\nηEQE ¼ γ � φF � ηr � ηout ð1Þ\\n\\nwhere γ is the charge carrier balance factor, φF is the photoluminescence quantum yield\\n\\n(PLQY), ηr is the exciton utilization ratio for radiation, ηout is the light outcoupling fac-\\n\\ntor. The γ is usually recommended as high as 100% with suitable device structures. The\\n\\nηout is defined as 20–30% due to refractive index of different layers, which can be fur-\\n\\nther improved by tuning molecular orientation or adopting out-coupling enhancement\\n\\nstructures [18–20], such as microlens arrays, prisms and micro-structured substrates.\\n\\nDifferent from photoexcitation, singlet and triplet excitons are generated by electron/\\n\\nhole recombination with 1:3 ratio on the basis of spin statistics under electrical excita-\\n\\ntion in OLEDs. Therefore, traditional fluorescent OLEDs are limited to 25% internal\\n\\nquantum efficiency with the theoretically highest EQE of 5–7.5% [21]. To further\\n\\nimprove the efficiency of OLEDs, numerous light-emitting materials with different\\n\\nphotophysical processes, such as phosphorescence, hybridized local and charge transfer\\n\\n(HLCT) [22], triplet–triplet fusion (TTF) [23] and thermally activated delayed fluores-\\n\\ncence (TADF) [24] have been explored and utilized to harvest the 75% triplet excitons\\n\\nfor luminescence. By introducing AIE property into these different types of emitters,\\n\\nhigh PLQYs in solid films can be guaranteed to construct stable and efficient OLEDs.\\n\\nUp to now, the emission colors of the OLEDs based on multifunctional AIEgens have\\n\\ncovered the entire visible region, greatly contributing to the vitalization of the OLED\\n\\nmarket.\\n\\nAIEgens for blue and white OLEDs\\n\\nThe devices that emit red, green and blue (RGB) primary colors have always been the\\n\\nfocus in OLED display [25–27]. With color conversion technology, blue light can also\\n\\nbe converted to green and red light. In addition, efficient blue emitters in white light il-\\n\\nlumination can not only reduce power consumption, but also facilitate the acquisition\\n\\nof higher color temperature and color rendering index (CRI). Nevertheless, due to the\\n\\nhigh triplet energy and long exciton lifetime, blue emitters still remain as a big chal-\\n\\nlenge in comparison with green and red emitters, and thus blue OLEDs with high effi-\\n\\nciency and long operating time are always not satisfactory [28]. To address this issue,\\n\\nthe further exploration of robust blue emitters is of high importance. Recently, AIEgens\\n\\nhave realized encouraging achievements in constructing blue emitters, and this review\\n\\nwill focus on the represitative advancements of blue emitters based on AIEgens, and\\n\\ntheir performance in blue and white OLEDs.\\n\\nAnthracene is a traditional building block to construct blue luminescent materials\\n\\n[29]. However, the rigid and planar molecule structure of anthracene is prone to form\\n\\ncompact π–π stacking in solid state, which is usually undesired for light emitting.\\n\\n\\n\\nYu et al.

Then,\\n\\nthe corresponding molecule TPE-TAPBI [30] with a twisted conformation was obtained\\n\\nand showed a low PLQY of 3.9% in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. But in film, TPE-\\n\\nTAPBI radiated blue light at 459 nm with a high PLQY of 64.2%, exhibiting typical AIE\\n\\nproperty. Additionally, the introduction of 1,2-diphenylbenzo [d] imidazole (PBI), an\\n\\nimportant moiety of commercial electron-transporting material 1,3,5-tri(1-phenyl-1H-\\n\\nbenzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl (TPBi), could balance carrier transport capacity and in-\\n\\ncrease exciton recombination of TPE-TAPBI. As a result, a good electron mobility\\n\\nvalue of 3.85 × 10− 5 cm2 V− 1 s− 1 for TPE-TAPBI was achieved at an electric field of\\n\\n5.5 × 105 V cm− 1. Strong solid-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity and high electron\\n\\nmobility guaranteed its potential device performance.

It is worth noting that the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies dropped\\n\\nslowly with a low roll-off at 1000 cd m− 2. Inspired by the outstanding performance of\\n\\nthe nondoped blue OLED, two-color hybrid white OLED (WOLED) was fabricated with\\n\\na structure of ITO/HATCN (150 nm)/NPB (15 nm)/TAPC (5 nm)/NPB: bis[2-(2-hydro-\\n\\nxyphenyl)-pyridine]beryllium (Bepp2): bis(2-phenyl-4,5-dimethylpyridinato)[2-(bi-\\n\\nphenyl-3-yl)pyridinato]iridium (III) [Ir(dmppy)2(dpp)] (25 nm, 0.5:0.5:0.1)/TAPC:Bepp2\\n\\n(4 nm, 0.7:0.3)/TPE-TAPBI (15 nm)/TmPyPB (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al. High singlet en-\\n\\nergy and triplet energy of the mixed interlayer could effectively prohibit the mutual ex-\\n\\ncitons transfer and quenching processes. The WOLED exhibited warm white light and\\n\\ntotal power efficiency (PE), current efficiency (CE) and EQE of 70.5 lmW− 1, 76.0 cd\\n\\nA− 1 and 28% at 1000 cd m− 2, respectively. The PE, CE and EQE still remained as 49.8\\n\\nlmW− 1, 75.0 cd A− 1 and 25.7% at 5000 cd m− 2, demonstrating very good efficiency sta-\\n\\nbility (Fig. 1b).\\n\\nLater, a new blue AIEgen (TPE-TADC) with a higher PLQY of 72.8% in neat film was\\n\\nprepared by replacing electron-transporting unit PBI with the hole-transporting carbazole\\n\\ngroups [31]. The forked carbazole-based substitute could increase carrier transport as well\\n\\nas triplet energy level. TPE-TADC showed a good hole mobility of 7.96 × 10− 6 cm2 V− 1\\n\\ns− 1 at an electric field of 5.5 × 105 V cm− 1. And the regular horizontal orientation of tran-\\n\\nsition dipole moment of TPE-TADC could enhance the light out-coupling efficiency over\\n\\n0.3 to contribute to EL efficiency. As expected, the nondoped OLED constructed with\\n\\nTPE-TADC afforded good EL performances of 6.81 cd A− 1, 6.57 lmW− 1, and 5.71% (Fig.\\n\\n1c). By utilizing TPE-TADC as the emissive layer, highly efficient two-color hybrid white\\n\\nOLEDs were achieved, furnishing modulable light color from pure white (CIEx,y = 0.33,\\n\\n0.33) to warm white (CIEx,y = 0.44, 0.46) and excellent forward-viewing EL efficiencies of\\n\\n56.7 cd A− 1, 55.2 lmW− 1, and 19.2% (Fig. 1d).\\n\\nBy tuning the twisted angles between the aromatic building blocks, Li et al. [32] suc-\\n\\ncessfully developed a benzene-cored blue luminogen 3TPA-CN with aggregation-\\n\\nenhanced emission (AEE) property. Based on the excellent hole-transporting ability of\\n\\n3TPA-CN, the simple nondoped OLED without the hole-transporting layer showed a\\n\\nmaximum EQE of 3.89%. Afterwards, the optimized blue OLED [33] with a structure of\\n\\nITO/HATCN (5 nm)/TAPC (50 nm)/TCTA (5 nm)/3TPA-CN (20 nm)/TmPyPB (40\\n\\nnm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al realized a higher EQE of 6.3%. In addition, 3TPA-CN could also\\n\\nserve as a host material for orange emissive phosphorescent OLED with a maximum\\n\\nEQE of 18.2%, representing that AIEgens had been successfully employed as hosts in\\n\\nphosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) for the first time. As excellent blue emitter and\\n\\nphosphor host, 3TPA-CN was further used to fabricate two-color WOLED, providing\\n\\nmaximum PE and EQE as high as 86.7 lmW− 1 and 22.3%, respectively.\\n\\nMa et al. [34] developed a multifunctional bipolar deep blue AIEgen, TPB-AC, with a\\n\\nhigh triplet energy of 2.48 eV and a superior PLQY of 98.6% in neat film (Fig. 2a). No-\\n\\nticeably, TPB-AC neat film showed a high horizontal dipole ratio of 79%, revealing a\\n\\ngreat potential in development of high-performance nondoped OLEDs. As a result,\\n\\nTPB-AC was not only suitable to fabricate the pure blue OLED with the maximum\\n\\nEQE of 7.0% and extremely low efficiency roll-off of 10% at 1000 cdm− 2, but also a\\n\\ngreat host for PhOLEDs with maximum EQEs of 21.0% for green, 27.3% for orange,\\n\\nand 26.1% for red OLEDs, which even still remained at 19.5%, 25.9%, and 24.1% at\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 2 a Molecular structure of TPB-AC and EL performances for nondoped OLED, PhOLEDs and WOLEDs\\nbased on TPB-AC. b and c EQE − luminance curves of nondoped OLED, PhOLEDs and WOLEDs; inset: EL\\ncurves for the OLEDs.

Furthermore, easily manufactured high-efficiency\\n\\nhybrid WOLEDs, which used pure TPB-AC as a blue-emitting layer without existence\\n\\nof interlayer, were fabricated. The maximum CE, PE and EQE reached 83.5 cd A− 1,\\n\\n99.9 lmW− 1 and 25.6% for the two-color WOLED, and 54.8 cd A− 1, 60.7 lmW− 1 and\\n\\n25.3% for the four-color WOLED, respectively (Fig. 2c).\\n\\nTo increase the efficiency of the OLEDs, it is also a favorable approach to improve\\n\\nηr by harnessing other 75% triplet excitons through hybridized local and charge-\\n\\ntransfer (HLCT) state mechanisms [35, 36]. Wang et al. [37] reported ppCTPI (Fig. 3)\\n\\nbased on a typical HLCT core phenanthroimidazole (PI). TPE, a most popular\\n\\nAIE-active building block, was connected to the long axis with para-linkages to\\n\\ntune the locally excited (LE) component in HLCT state (Fig. 3b). Besides, a benzo-\\n\\nnitrile with a cyano group (CN) was introduced into the short axis to tune the\\n\\ncharge transfer (CT) component in HLCT state. Therefore, the “hot exciton”\\n\\nconversion channels between S1 and T4 (THLCT-SHLCT) as well as S2 and T8\\n(THLCT-SHLCT) were constructed and conductive to generating more emissive sing-\\n\\nlet excitons. The nondoped sky-blue OLED with a device configuration of ITO/\\n\\nHATCN (5 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/TCTA (5 nm)/ppCTPI (20 nm)/TmPyPB (40 nm)/\\n\\nLiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm) exhibited the maximum luminance, CE, PE and EQE of 31,\\n\\n070 cd m− 2, 18.46 cd A− 1, 16.32 lmW− 1 and 7.16%, respectively, with small effi-\\n\\nciency roll-off of 4.0% at 1000 cd m− 2.\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 3 a Typical energy level characteristics of a HLCT emitter with a “hot exciton” channel; b the long-short\\naxis design based on phenanthroimidazole. c Construction of the LE state and the CT state in ppCTPI.\\nReprinted with permission from ref.

The delayed EL component was observed in time-resolved EL response\\n\\nanalysis, confirming the existence of TTF processes. Nondoped blue OLED with TPEA\\n\\nexhibited the maximum PE of 11.1 lmW− 1, CE of 9.9 cd A− 1, and EQE of 5.6%. To fa-\\n\\ncilitate injection and transport of carriers, broaden the exciton recombination zone and\\n\\nalleviate exciton quenching effect, the doped device was fabricated and displayed deep-\\n\\nblue emission at 445 nm (CIEx,y = 0.15, 0.09) with an excellent maximum EQE of 8.0%.\\n\\nHost materials play an important role in improving carrier injection and transport,\\n\\nand modulating EL color via energy-transfer mechanism in OLEDs [41–43]. Thus, de-\\n\\nvelopment of qualitative host materials is of great significance for optimizing EL per-\\n\\nformance. The bipolar host material, DPMBP-DMAC [44], was designed and behaved\\n\\nwith excellent carrier injection and transport ability due to pyridine and 9,9-dimethyl-9,\\n\\n10-dihydroacridine (DMAC) moieties. The existence of AIE characteristic of host mate-\\n\\nrials could effectively restrain exciton annihilation in light-emitting layer and lower effi-\\n\\nciency roll-off of the devices.

Metal-free TADF\\n\\ncan efficiently harvest both singlet and triplet excitons through reverse intersystem\\n\\ncrossing (RISC) process, relying on the small singlet-triplet energy gap (ΔEST) [50–52].\\n\\nIdeally, the OLEDs based on TADF materials can achieve 100% internal quantum effi-\\n\\nciency, and thus provide excellent EL performances, but there are still some challenges\\n\\nthat greatly delay the practical commercial applications of TADF materials. Conven-\\n\\ntional TADF materials suffer from concentration-caused emission quenching and ser-\\n\\nious exciton annihilation processes, and thus exhibit drastic efficiency roll-off at high\\n\\nvoltages. The integration of AIE property into TADF emitters will effectively alleviate\\n\\nthis problem. Up to now, a series of robust aggregation-induced delayed fluorescence\\n\\n(AIDF) luminogens have been developed and brought about a new breakthrough for\\n\\nexcellent nondoped OLEDs.\\n\\nYasuda et al. [53] developed three AIDF molecules (PCZ-CB-TRZ, TPA-CB-TRZ,\\n\\nand 2PCZ-CB) (Fig. 6) based on electron-deficient icosahedral boron cluster, o-carbor-\\n\\nane, which exhibited strong yellow-to-red emissions with high PLQYs of up to 97% in\\n\\nneat film. More specifically, the calculated ΔEST values (0.003–0.146 eV) were small\\n\\nenough to achieve effective RISC to facilitate TADF owing to a large spatial separation\\n\\nof the frontier orbitals. The nondoped OLED with a structure of ITO/4,4′-bis-[N-(1-\\n\\nnaphthyl)-N-phenylamino]-1,1′-biphenyl (α-NPD) (35 nm)/1,3-bis (carbazol-9-yl) ben-\\n\\nzene (mCP) (10 nm)/PCZ-CB-TRZ (20 nm)/2,8-bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,\\n\\nd]thiophene) (PPT) (40 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al displayed an EL peak at 586 nm with max-\\n\\nimum EQE and luminance of 11.0% and 4530 cdm− 2, respectively. Besides, other AIDF\\n\\nmolecules, PTZ-XT and PTZ-BP [54], were reported by the same group, in which\\n\\nphenothiazine was coupled with xanthone or benzophenone acceptor unit to create D-\\n\\nA structures. The maximum EQE values of the nondoped yellow OLEDs based on\\n\\nPTZ-XT and PTZ-BP were 11.1% and 7.6%, respectively.\\n\\nAlthough the EL performances of the above discussed AIDF materials achieved lim-\\n\\nited advancement, the further works demonstrated that the AIDF materials were indeed\\n\\npromising to break the limit of exciton utilization and alleviate efficiency roll-off. For\\n\\nexample, DBT-BZ-DMAC [55] with an asymmetrical D-A-D′ structure possessed a\\n\\nprominent AIDF characteristic.

Then, three new mol-\\n\\necules, DMF-BP-PXZ, DPF-BP-PXZ and SBF-BP-PXZ [58] (Fig. 6), were synthesized to\\n\\nstudy the AIDF process. These materials showed weak emissions with short fluorescence\\n\\nlifetimes in THF solutions. But they could emit strongly and the fluorescence lifetime be-\\n\\ncame much longer with obvious delayed component in neat films (1.1–1.4 μs), exhibiting\\n\\nintriguing AIDF properties. By further calculating the photophysical transition rates of\\n\\nthese luminogens, it was found that the kIC values were decreased from solutions (3.1 ×\\n\\n108–5.5 × 108 s− 1) to neat films (1.3 × 107–1.6 × 107 s− 1), which were comparable to the\\n\\nkISC values (7.7 × 10\\n6–9.7 × 106 s− 1).

Common host materials\\n\\nwere used to synthesize new AIDF materials DCB-BP-PXZ, CBP-BP-PXZ, mCP-BP-\\n\\nPXZ and mCBP-BP-PXZ (Figs. 6 and 9) [59].

Nondoped OLEDs with a simple\\n\\nthree-layer configuration of ITO/TAPC (25 nm)/emitter (35 nm)/TmPyPB (55 nm)/LiF\\n\\n(1 nm)/Al were fabricated. Impressively, the highest luminance of 100,126 cd m− 2 was\\n\\nachieved in OLED based on mCBP-BP-PXZ. All devices revealed maximum CE, PE and\\n\\nEQE of 69.0–72.9 cd A− 1, 75.0–81.8 lmW− 1 and 21.4–22.6%, respectively, with small\\n\\nefficiency roll-off of 8.7–11.4% at 5000 cd m− 2 (Fig. 7c).\\n\\nTheoretically, the short delayed fluorescence lifetime can effectively reduce triplet ex-\\n\\nciton annihilation at high voltages and alleviate the roll-off of EL efficiency. The heavy\\n\\natom effect can be strategically utilized to increase the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), real-\\n\\nizing a fast RISC and thus a short lifetime [60, 61]. Then, three AIDF molecules deco-\\n\\nrated with chlorine atom(s), 3-CCP-BPPXZ, 9-CCP-BP-PXZ and 3,9-CCP-BP-PXZ [62]\\n\\n(Figs. 6 and 7d), were explored. Obvious interactions of chlorine and carbonyl with\\n\\nneighboring aromatic moieties were observed in crystals, inducing efficient orbital cou-\\n\\nplings. As a result, the calculated SOC values of these luminogens boosted from 0.002–\\n\\n0.007 cm− 1 in gas phase to 0.234–0.406 cm− 1 in solid phase. Furthermore, 3-CCP-BP-\\n\\nPXZ, 9-CCP-BP-PXZ and 3,9-CCP-BP-PXZ had relatively short delayed lifetimes of\\n\\n0.76, 0.68 and 0.42 μs, corresponding to the kRISC of 1.73 × 10\\n6, 1.97 × 106 and 3.10 ×\\n\\n106 s− 1, respectively. In addition, very small ΔEST values of 0.016–0.019 eV and high\\n\\nPLQYs of 70.4–73.0% were attained. The nondoped OLED of 3-CCP-BP-PXZ provided\\n\\nthe maximum CE, PE, and EQE of up to 76.6 cd A− 1, 75.2 lmW− 1, and 21.7%, respect-\\n\\nively (Fig. 7d). These new AIDF emitters could also be used to fabricate doped OLEDs\\n\\nwith a wide doping concentration range of 5–90 wt%, giving excellent concentration-\\n\\ninsensitive EL performances. The doped OLED of 3-CCP-BP-PXZ with 5 wt% doping\\n\\nconcentration showed impressive maximum CE, PE, and EQE of 100.1 cd A− 1, 104.8\\n\\nlmW− 1, and 29.1%, respectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, Su et al. [63] reported two molecules based on benzophenone, CCDC and\\n\\nCCDD. The branched donors, where a carbazole unit was linked with other carbazole or\\n\\ndiphenylamine, could increase the PLQY and the electron donating ability. The PLQY of\\n\\nCCDD with a rotatable structure increased from lower than 1% in THF solution to 30.8%\\n\\nin neat film, demonstrating the AIE effect. In contrast, the interlocked phenyl rings on the\\n\\ncarbazole induced a coplanar conformation for CCDC (Fig. 10a). The ΔEST of CCDC was\\n\\n0.147 eV and that of CCDD was 0.045 eV. The maximum EQEs of CCDD based non-\\n\\ndoped and doped OLEDs were 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively.\\n\\nTo further enhance solid-state emission efficiency and improve color purity, Cheng\\n\\net al. [64] designed two new emitters, 2QPM-mDTC and 4QPM-mDTC, based on the\\n\\nbenzophenone acceptor (Fig. 10b). The introduction of a secondary acceptor, quinoline,\\n\\nin 2QPM-mDTC could induce intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the o-hydro-\\n\\ngen on the central phenyl and the nitrogen of quinoline. Therefore, the molecular\\n\\nstructure of 2QPM-mDTC was rigidified to certain degree, which was beneficial to nar-\\n\\nrow emission peak and enhance emission intensity. The PLQY of 2QPM-mDTC was\\n\\nup to 98% in 7 wt% doped 3,3′-di(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (mCBP) film, which was much\\n\\nhigher than that in toluene (6.5%), presenting obvious AIE property. On the contrary,\\n\\nthe hydrogen bonding couldn’t form in 4QPM-mDTC because of the long distance be-\\n\\ntween nitrogen and o-hydrogen, resulting in a relatively lower PLQY of 80% in doped\\n\\nfilm. In addition, the RISC between singlet charge transfer (1CT) state and triplet local\\n\\nexcited (3LE) state was favored in these two molecules, leading to delayed fluorescence.\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 10 Molecular structures of (A) CCDC and CCDD, and (B) 2QPM-mDTC and 4QPM-mDTC.

Generally, in OLED displays, antiglare filters are\\n\\nused to remove glare from external light sources by exploiting the nature of circle po-\\n\\nlarized (CP) light. Meanwhile, nearly 50% of the nonpolarized light emitted from the\\n\\nOLED pixel is also eliminated, leading to large efficiency loss. In contrast, circularly po-\\n\\nlarized OLEDs (CPOLEDs) [74] can directly generate CP light with simple device archi-\\n\\ntectures, which will open up a new avenue for organic optoelectronic devices. So far,\\n\\nvarious kinds of CPL materials have been continuously developed to fabricate CPO-\\n\\nLEDs with intense circularly polarized EL. However, it is still challenging to realize\\n\\nhighly efficient CPOLEDs due to the obstacle of ACQ problems of the chiral emitting\\n\\nmaterials. Therefore, the development of effective chiral emitters with AIE effect will\\n\\nbe of great significance for future display.\\n\\nAxial chirality moieties are extensively adopted as blocks to build CPL materials, such\\n\\nas binaphtyl, ctahydro-binaphthol, diaminocyclohexane, and their derivatives. To pur-\\n\\nsue the CPOLEDs with high EQEs and small efficiency roll-off, a series of CPL emitters\\n\\nwith AIE and TADF characteristics R/S-BN-CF, R/S-BN-CCB, R/S-BN-DCB, and R/S-\\n\\nBN-AF [75], were developed based on binaphthalene unit (Fig. 13a). The single-crystal\\n\\nstructures of R-BN-CF and S-BN-DCB demonstrated twisted molecular conformations\\n\\nand multiple weak intermolecular interactions, which efficiently suppressed concentra-\\n\\ntion quenching and exciton annihilation. Therefore, the PLQY of S-BN-CF in neat film\\n\\nwas 38.7%, which fell to 2% in methanol solution, suggesting the typical AIE feature. In\\n\\naddition, the twisted structure was conductive to low electronic coupling and efficient\\n\\nseparation of HOMO and LUMO. Thus, small ΔEST values of 0.02–0.15 eV were ob-\\n\\ntained, rendering the molecule with prominent delayed fluorescence property.

Moreover, the gabs and circularly polarized\\n\\nphotoluminescence dissymmetry factors (gPL) of these molecules were magnified from\\n\\nsolution state to film state. In other words, the AIEgens tended to form the population\\n\\nof chiral aggregates in cluster process, which indicated the chiroptical amplification of\\n\\nboth ground state and excited state. The configuration of nondoped OLED was illus-\\n\\ntrated as ITO/HATCN (10 nm)/TAPC (60 nm)/mCP (10 nm)/S-BN-CF (20 nm)/(3,3″,\\n\\n5,5″-tetra(pyridin-3-yl)-1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl) (BmPyPB) (50 nm)/Liq (2.5 nm)/Al. The\\n\\nmaximum luminance, CE and EQE of 2570 cd m− 2, 10.28 cd A− 1 and 3.51%, respect-\\n\\nively, with circularly polarized EL dissymmetry factors (gEL) value of + 0.026 were\\n\\nattained. The doped device of S-BN-CF exhibited a gEL value of + 0.06 with the max-\\n\\nimum luminance, CE and EQE of 2948 cd m− 2, 24.58 cd A− 1 and 9.31%, respectively.\\n\\nThe high gEL for nondoped device may be attributed to the population of chiral aggre-\\n\\ngates in neat film (Fig. 13b).\\n\\nZheng et al. [76] reported a pair of TADF enantiomers (R)-OBN-Cz and (S)-OBN-Cz\\n\\n(Fig. 13a), in which the octahydro-binaphthol (OBN) units served as chiral sources to\\n\\ngenerate and induce chirality. Besides, due to peripheral sixteen hydrogen atoms in\\n\\ncyclohexane parts, OBN unit possessed great steric hindrance to suppress close stack-\\n\\ning of molecules. For (R)-OBN-Cz, the neat film and doped film showed higher PLQYs\\n\\nof 81% and 92% than those in toluene, demonstrating obvious AIE effect. In addition,\\n\\nthe OBN units also could induce a regular orientation to generate horizontal dipoles in\\n\\nthe vacuum-evaporating process for increasing the light out-coupling of OLEDs. The\\n\\nTADF property was introduced by the interaction of carbazole and cyan moieties,\\n\\nwhich were occupied by HOMO and LUMO, respectively. As a result, the small experi-\\n\\nmental ΔEST of 0.037 eV for (R)-OBN-Cz led to efficient RISC process. The maximum\\n\\nband around 400 nm could be allocated to the absorption of the D–A electronic struc-\\n\\nture, induced by chirality of OBN unit in the ground state. The CPL spectra of enantio-\\n\\nmers showed gPL values of − 4.6 × 10\\n− 4 for (R)-OBN-Cz and + 5.6 × 10− 4 for (S)-OBN-\\n\\nCz in toluene. Whereas the gPL values of enantiomers both in neat and doped films\\n\\nwere significantly improved to 1.55 × 10− 3 and 2.14 × 10− 3, respectively, revealing chir-\\n\\nality amplification effect in aggregation process. The CPOLED based on D-D(R) was\\n\\nfabricated as ITO/HATCN (10 nm)/TAPC (60 nm)/TCTA: (R)-OBN-Cz (10 wt%) (5\\n\\nnm)/26DCzPPy: (R)-OBN-Cz (10 wt%) (15 nm)/TmPyPB (60 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al. For\\n\\nthe double-emitting layer, TCTA could act as both hole-transporting “ladder” and host,\\n\\nwhich would lower the driving voltage and broad the exciton recombination zone. The\\n\\ndevice of D-D(R) showed green emission at 501 nm (CIEx,y = 0.22, 0.53) with a full\\n\\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) of 66 nm. It is noticeable that the device of D-D(R)\\n\\ndisplayed maximum brightness, CE, PE and EQE of 46,651 cd m− 2, 93.7 cd A− 1, 59.3\\n\\nlmW− 1 and 32.6%, respectively, with a gEL value of − 1.94 × 10\\n− 3. The nondoped device\\n\\nof D-NF(R) showed maximum brightness, CE, PE and EQE of 35,633 cd m− 2, 47.8 cd\\n\\nA− 1, 34.6 lmW− 1 and 14.0%, respectively, with a gEL value of − 2.34 × 10\\n− 3 (Fig. 13c).\\n\\nIn addition, triphenylamine-substituted enantiomer, (R/S)-OBN-DPA [77], was\\n\\nsynthesized by the same group. The nondoped and doped CPOLEDs achieved\\n\\nmarkedly CPL signals with gEL values of up to 2.9 × 10\\n− 3 (Fig. 13c), high brightness\\n\\nover 25,000 cd cm− 2 and high maximum EQE of 12.4%.\\n\\nChen et al.

[79] synthesized chiral BINOL-based chiral polymers, S-P and R-P, by\\n\\nthe Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling polymerization reaction. The clear mirror-image CD\\n\\nbands were observed in spin-coated films of S-/R-P enantiomers.

To evaluate the circularly\\n\\npolarized EL performance of the enantiomers, OLEDs with configurations of ITO/\\n\\nPEDOT: PSS (25 nm)/S-P or R-P (45 nm)/TPBI (35 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Ag were fabricated.\\n\\nThe maximum CE, PE and brightness were 0.926/0.833 cd A− 1, 0.390/0.422 lmW− 1\\n\\nand 1669/1270 cd m− 2 for the doping-free devices based on S-P and R-P, respectively.\\n\\nThe corresponding gEL values were evaluated as + 0.024 and − 0.019. To further im-\\n\\nprove the performances of CPOLEDs, the same group was incorporated with TADF\\n\\nmechanism to harvest triplet excitons, and two pairs of small molecules R-1/S-1 and R-\\n\\n2/S-2 were designed by extending the conjugated skeletons of chiral BINOL [80]. R-1/\\n\\nS-1 and R-2/S-2 possessed prominent AIE property and displayed emission peaks at\\n\\n587 and 547 nm in neat films with PLQYs of 2.3% and 5.9%, respectively. Meanwhile,\\n\\nthe PLQYs were greatly enhanced to 18.5% and 15.7% when doping in TCTA. For S-1\\n\\nand S-2, the HOMO was distributed on phenoxazine moiety, whereas the LUMO was\\n\\n\\n\\nYu et al.

The effective separation of\\n\\nHOMO and LUMO was favored to the occurrence of TADF with high kRISC values of\\n\\n1.4 × 106 s− 1 and 4.2 × 106 s− 1. By fixing the conjugation skeleton with oxygen bridge,\\n\\nthe gPL values of R-1 and S-1 were − 1.2 × 10\\n− 3/+ 1.6 × 10− 3, − 7.1 × 10− 4/+ 9.2 × 10− 4\\n\\nand − 7.2 × 10− 4/+ 8.2 × 10− 4 in toluene, neat films, and doped films, respectively,\\n\\nwhereas no CPL signals were detected for R-2/S-2.

Two polymers P5 and P10 [81] (Fig. 15a) with different amounts of\\n\\nmonomer units were synthesized by modified Suzuki coupling, with the calculated\\n\\nAIDF unit contents of 4.5% and 10.5% for P5 and P10, respectively. The PLQYs of P5\\n\\nand P10 were 2.8% and 3.9% in THF, and 6.7% and 10.3% in solid states, respectively.\\n\\nP5 and P10 showed kRISC values of 2.07 × 10\\n6 and 2.50 × 106 s− 1, and τdelayed values of\\n\\n1.358 and 1.366 μs, respectively, revealing favored TADF properties. In addition, the\\n\\nnegative CPL signals for P5 and P10 of − 2.01 × 10− 3 and − 1.39 × 10− 3 were obtained\\n\\n(Fig. 15b). The introduction of 9-octyl-9H-carbazole moiety resulted in facile solubility\\n\\nand processability.

Then, photons are concentrated on the substrate edges by total internal\\nFig. 15 a The molecule structure of P5/10; b CPL and EL spectra of P5 and P10 in film. Reprinted with\\npermission from ref.

Therefore, the solar cells can be placed at the edges to collect the con-\\n\\ncentrated light and produce electric power, which can reduce the area of photovoltaic\\n\\ncell and lower equipment cost. Currently, the performances of LSCs have been vastly\\n\\nlimited by the reabsorption losses because the surrounding chromophores may re-\\n\\nabsorb the emitted photons during the multiple internal reflection process [84].\\n\\nTraditional chromophores used in LSCs, such as rhodamines and coumarins, generally\\n\\nhave planar conjugated structures and suffer from both concentration quenching and\\n\\nself-absorption due to small Stokes shifts [85]. A common solution to this problem is\\n\\nto reduce the concentration of chromophores, but it means less light can be absorbed\\n\\nby the LSC at a given LSC device [86]. A more effective approach is to use AIEgen as\\n\\nthe chromophore for LSCs. The twisted aromatic AIE materials usually have large\\n\\nStokes shifts that can reduce reabsorption effectively. And no matter AIEgens are made\\n\\ninto thin-films or dispersed in the matrix, it will not reduce the collection efficiency be-\\n\\ncause they are free of concentration quenching. These distinctive advantages provide\\n\\nan important idea for the fabrication of highly efficient LSC devices.\\n\\nWong et al. first applied AIE-active materials for solar harvesting in LSC devices in\\n\\n2014 [87, 88]. They fabricated monolithic LSC devices by drop-casting 10 wt% of the\\n\\nstar AIE-active material, TPE, in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The PLQY of the\\n\\ndrop-coating film was measured to be 40%. The photophysical properties of the fluoro-\\n\\nphores in the LSC were closely related to the optical edge efficiency (ηedge), which is de-\\n\\nfined as the ratio of the number of fluorescence photons that are waveguided to the\\n\\nedges relative to the number of the incident photons. The ηedge of the LSC with TPE in\\n\\nPMMA, fabricated on glass substrates with dimensions of 10 mm × 10mm × 1mm, was\\n\\nfound to be 13.2%. And the large Stokes shift of 1.11 eV could effectively reduce re-\\n\\nabsorption. Furthermore, other four TPE derivatives with extended conjugated skele-\\n\\ntons were synthesized to generate better coupling with photovoltaic cells (Fig. 16).\\n\\nSubsequently, Wong et al. combined an excitation energy transfer (EET) strategy with\\nFig. 16 Photos of PMMA films containing TPE and four TPE derivatives at 10% w/w in PMMA upon\\nexcitation with a UV light source.

The branched donor\\n\\nDPATPAN displayed AIE behavior with a large Stokes shift and a high PLQY of 92%\\n\\n(Fig. 17a) [89]. The small reabsorption loss of LSC was achieved through low absorp-\\n\\ntion contribution of the acceptor. The experimental optical quantum efficiency (OQE)\\n\\nof LSC device based on DPATPAN-DCJTB system was about 58.2%. However, the\\n\\ntraditional acceptor DCJTB underwent concentration quenching, limiting their practical\\n\\napplications. Wong et al. [90] further replaced DCJTB with AIE-active groups, PITBT-\\n\\nTPE, in LSCs (Fig. 17b). The emission spectrum of DPATPAN overlapped well with\\n\\nthe absorption spectrum of PITBT-TPE, which was beneficial to energy migration. And\\n\\nthe absorption spectrum of DPTPAN and the emission spectrum of PITBT-TPE was\\n\\nseparated obviously which could avoid reabsorption of acceptor emission by the donor.\\n\\nPucci et al. [91] conducted an in-depth study on the utilization of red-emitting AIE\\n\\nmaterials in LSCs based on PMMA and polycarbonate (PC) (Fig. 18a). They dispersed a\\n\\nTPE derivative, TPE-AC, at 0.1–1.5 wt% contents in PC or PMMA. The films showed\\n\\nwide absorption bands at 400 and 550 nm and fluorescence emission peaking at 600–\\n\\n630 nm. The LSC based on the red AIEgen exhibited a high optical efficiency (ηopt) of\\n\\n6.7%. Afterwards, Pucci et al. [92] reported the AIEgen TPE_RED, an initiator to pre-\\n\\npare red-emitting PMMA, i.e. PMMA_TPE_RED (Fig. 18b). In the work, TPE_RED ini-\\n\\ntiated the polymerization of methyl methacrylate, and the polymer films of PMMA_\\n\\nTPE_RED behaved an excellent PLQY of 26.5%. The PMMA_TPE_RED film showed\\n\\nbright emission peaking at 650 nm with a large Stokes shift of about 170 nm, which\\n\\ncould control the reabsorption at a quite low level.

Liou et al. reported several meaning-\\n\\nful works by combining TPA units with AIEgens. Some AIE-active polymers were suc-\\n\\ncessfully prepared in 2018. The existence of TPA unit could effectively quench the\\n\\nemission of polyamides from neutral to oxidized states. And TPE unit was incorporated\\n\\ninto the system for obtaining enhanced illumination capability. The EFC devices based\\n\\non TPA-CN-CH/HV (n-heptyl viologen) showed the highest contrast ratio (Ioff/Ion) of\\n\\n105. The device based on TPA-OMe-TPE/HV exhibited the shortest response time of\\n\\nquenching process less than 4.9 s. Whereas the response time of lighting processes was\\n\\nas long as 69 s, which was not favorable for EFC devices [100]. Then, Liou et al. further\\n\\nsynthesized two AIE-active materials, TPETPAOMe and BTOTPAOMe, to fabricate\\n\\nthe EFC devices by a new technique of cross-linking gel-type. The EFC devices based\\n\\non TPETPAOMe/HV behaved cyan-blue emission with a maximum peak at 505 nm\\n\\nunder UV excitation, and the emission could be quenched by increasing the applied\\n\\nvoltage from − 0.10 to 1.60 V (Fig. 19). Upon applying potential back to − 0.10 V, the\\n\\ndevices showed bright emission again. The contrast ratios (Ioff/Ion) of the devices based\\n\\non TPAOMe/HV and BTOTPAOMe/HV reached 6.89 and 6.66, respectively, and the\\n\\nresponse time of lighting processes was successfully shortened to 16.4 s.

The light-emitting LCDs (LE-LCDs) based on luminescent liquid crystal-\\n\\nline materials will be the promising alternatives to conventional LCDs [104, 105]. The\\n\\ncommonly used approach to obtain LE-LCDs is to mix luminescent materials and nem-\\n\\natic liquid crystals (LCs) with different concentrations. In order to achieve high con-\\n\\ntrast, high concentration of luminogens are usually required. However, conventional\\n\\nchromophores suffer from severe ACQ effect [106]. The unique advantages of AIEgens\\n\\nprovide an exciting way to fabricate high-performance LE-LCDs.\\n\\nRecently, it was found that TPE derivative, TPE-PPE, could emit anisotropically\\n\\n(Fig. 22a-c). The TPE-PPE/nematic LC mixture generated polarized luminescence\\n\\nand two types of LE-LCDs were fabricated.

PhotoniX            (2020) 1:11 Page 28 of 33\\nConclusion\\nAIEgens have got rapid development and attracted great attentions in various fields\\n\\nover the last 20 years, owing to their unique photophysical properties in the aggregated\\n\\nstate. Especially in the field of organic optoelectronics, functional materials derived\\n\\nfrom AIEgens have occupied the irreplaceable positions. In view of the significant\\n\\nachievements of AIEgens in recent years, this review presents representative advance-\\n\\nments of AIEgens for the optoelectronic device applications of OLED, LSC, EFC and\\n\\nLCD. The structure-function relationship and the performances of optoelectronic de-\\n\\nvices are elucidated in detail. In OLEDs, based on the high PLQYs and flexible\\n\\nstructure-tunability, blue AIEgens have been fully developed and applied in WOLEDs,\\n\\nhost materials and full-color display. To exceed the exciton utilization of traditional\\n\\nfluorescent materials, delayed fluorescence property is integrated in AIEgens, achieving\\n\\nexcellent EL efficiencies and negligible efficiency roll-off for nondoped OLEDs. With\\n\\nfurther decoration of CPL character on AIEgens, the OLEDs can emit circularly\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 24 BINOL-CN dope into acommon achiral nematic liquid crystal can self-assemble, and these\\nassemblies showed high luminescence dissymmetry factor.

To promote the\\n\\ncommercialization of AIEgens in OLEDs, more efficient AIEgens with deep blue and\\n\\nred emissions are highly desired. The materials stability and device lifetime are import-\\n\\nant but still challenging. In LSCs, AIEgens with twisted aromatic structure can reduce\\n\\nthe reabsorption effectively caused by the large Stokes shift as well as emission quench-\\n\\ning by concentration or aggregation. At the same time, AIEgens can allow high concen-\\n\\ntrations in LSCs to improve the collection effect instead of suffering from the ACQ\\n\\nproblem. In the following researches, adjusting the emission wavelength range to match\\n\\ndifferent solar cells and improving cycling stability may become a research hotspot. In\\n\\nEFC devices, AIEgens are hopeful to improve the contrast ratio. The future work may\\n\\nfocus on reducing the response time and increasing the stability of long-term operation\\n\\nof the device with a high contrast ratio. In LCDs, luminescent liquid crystals doped\\n\\nwith AIEgens show exciting sparkle with self-luminous property. But there is still much\\n\\nroom for further improvement in simplifying manufacturing process. Above all, we\\n\\nhope that this review can help researchers to explore more excellent AIEgen-based\\n\\nfunctional materials for the applications in organic optoelectronic fields as well as other\\n\\nresearch fronts.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21788102), the Natural\\nScience Foundation of Guangdong Province (2019B030301003), and the Science and Technology Program of\\nGuangzhou (201804020027).\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\nMaoxing Yu, Ruishan Huang and Jingjing Guo contributed to manuscript writing.

exam ( mmse ) [8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive\n","functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . likewise, apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been\n","associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523] . however , few studies have specifically\n","investigated the relationship between anxiety and\n","cognition in pd . one study showed a strong\n","negative relationship between anxiety ( both state\n","and trait ) and overall cognitive performance (\n","measured by the total of the repeatable battery\n","for the assessment of neuropsychological status\n","index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients .\n","furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively\n","associated with each of the cognitive domains\n","assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory ,\n","visuospatial construction , language , attention ,\n","and delayed memory ) . two further studies have\n","examined whether anxiety differentially affects\n","cognition in patients with left -

verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading\n","test and boston naming test ) . furthermore ,\n","anxiety was significantly correlated with\n","neuropsychological measures of attention

pd\n","and more specifically how anxiety might influence\n","particular domains of cognition such as attention\n","and memory and executive functioning . it is also\n","striking that , to date , no study has examined\n","the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by\n","directly comparing groups of pd patients with and\n","without anxiety while excluding depression . given\n","that research on healthy young adults suggests\n","that anxiety reduces processing capacity and\n","impairs processing efficiency , especially in the\n","central executive and attentional systems of\n","working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that\n","pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in\n","attentional set - shifting and working memory\n","compared to pd patients without anxiety .\n","furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited\n",", has focused on the influence of symptom\n","laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also\n","explored this relationship . seventeen pd patients\n","with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients\n","without anxiety were included in this study ( see\n","table 1 ) . the cross - sectional data from these\n","participants was taken from a

criteria involved a\n","diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united\n","kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank\n","criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist (\n","sjgl ) . patients also had to have an adequate\n","proficiency in english and have completed a full\n","neuropsychological assessment . ten patients in\n","this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without\n","anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. ,\n","benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake\n","inhibitor ) . patients were also excluded if they\n","had other neurological disorders , psychiatric\n","disorders other than affective disorders ( such as\n","anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater\n","than six on the depression subscale of the\n","hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) .\n","thus , all participants who scored within a\n","depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded\n","from this study , in attempt to examine a refined\n","sample of

the\n","university of sydney , and written informed\n","consent was obtained from all participants . self\n","- reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd\n","and has been previously shown to be a

demonstrated worse performance on the digit\n","span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm -\n","i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and\n","lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm %\n","retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to\n","rpda. this study is the first to directly compare\n","cognition between pd patients with and without\n","anxiety . the findings confirmed our hypothesis\n","that anxiety negatively influences attentional set\n","- shifting and working memory in pd . more\n","specifically , we found that pd patients with\n","anxiety were more impaired on the trail making\n","test part b which assessed attentional set -\n","shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed\n","working memory and attention , and to a lesser\n","extent on the logical memory test which assessed\n","memory and new verbal learning compared to pd\n","patients without anxiety . taken together , these\n","findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce\n","processing capacity and impair processing\n","efficiency , especially in the central executive\n","and attentional systems of working memory in a\n","similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 ,\n","27 ] . although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd\n","remains unknown , many researchers have postulated\n","that anxiety disorders are related to\n","neurochemical changes that occur during the early\n",", premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [\n","37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion\n",", as well as cell loss within serotonergic and\n","noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe\n","nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which\n","provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions )\n",". over time , chronic dysregulation of\n","adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can\n","lead to hippocampal damage as well as\n","dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 ,\n","40 ] , which play a key role in memory and\n","attention . recent functional neuroimaging work\n","has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation\n","during executive functioning and working memory\n","tasks may represent compensatory processes for\n","impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients\n","compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress\n","from anxiety , for example , may disrupt\n","compensatory processes in pd patients and explain\n","the cognitive impairments specifically in working\n","memory and attention seen in pd patients with\n","anxiety . it has also been suggested that\n","hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a\n","compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal\n","working memory performance in pd patients ;\n","however , losing this compensatory activation has\n","been shown to contribute to poor working memory\n","performance . anxiety in mild pd has been linked\n","to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes\n","more extensive as the disease progresses . this\n","further supports the notion that anxiety may\n","disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well ,\n","providing another possible explanation for the\n","cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with\n","anxiety in this study . noradrenergic and\n","serotonergic systems should also be considered\n","when trying to explain the mechanisms by which\n","anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although\n","these neurotransmitter systems are relatively\n","understudied in pd cognition , treating the\n","noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown\n","beneficial effects on cognition in pd . selective\n","serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was\n","shown to improve response inhibition deficits in\n","pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker ,\n","atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have\n","promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] .\n","overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been\n","conducted in pd in order to understand the neural\n","correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural\n","pathology . future research should focus on\n","relating anatomical changes and neurochemical\n","changes to neural activation in order to gain a\n","clearer understanding on how these pathologies\n","affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how\n","anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related ,\n","future research should focus on using advanced\n","structural and function imaging techniques to\n","explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that\n","are associated with anxiety in pd patients .\n","research has indicated that those with amnestic\n","mild cognitive impairment who have more\n","neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of\n","developing dementia compared to those with fewer\n","neuropsychiatric symptoms . future studies should\n","also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric\n","symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive\n","decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd\n","patients . previous studies have used pd symptom\n","laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical\n","dysfunction of neural circuits . for example , lpd\n","patients have greater inferred right hemisphere\n","pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater\n","inferred left hemisphere pathology . thus ,\n","cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the\n","left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks\n","of executive function and verbal memory ) might be\n","hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ;\n","however , this remains controversial . it has also\n","been suggested that since anxiety is a common\n","feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ]\n",", cognitive domains subserved by the left\n","hemisphere may also be more strongly related to\n","anxiety . results from this study showed selective\n","verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with\n","anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas\n","lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional\n","/ working memory deficits compared to lpd without\n","anxiety . although these results align with\n","previous research , interpretations of these\n","findings should be made with caution due to the\n","small sample size in the lpd comparison\n","specifically . recent work has suggested that the\n","hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of\n","anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a\n","less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50\n","] . in addition , our small sample size also\n","limited the statistical power for detecting\n","significant findings . based on these limitations\n",", our findings are likely conservative and\n","underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on\n","cognition in pd . additionally , the current study\n","employed a very brief neuropsychological\n","assessment including one or two tests for each\n","cognitive domain . future studies are encouraged\n","to collect a more complex and comprehensive\n","battery from a larger sample of pd participants in\n","order to better understand the role anxiety plays\n","on cognition in pd . another limitation of this\n","study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to\n","characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms\n","and specify the type of anxiety disorders included\n","in this study . future studies should perform\n","diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. ,\n","using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on\n","self - reported measures to group participants ,\n","in order to better understand whether the type of\n","anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias\n",", panic disorders , and generalized anxiety )\n","influences cognitive performance differently in pd\n",". one advantage the hads questionnaire provided\n","over other anxiety scales was that it assessed\n","both anxiety and depression simultaneously and\n","allowed us to control for coexisting depression .\n","although there was a trend that the pda+ group\n","self - reported higher levels of depression than\n","the pda group , all participants included in the\n","study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the\n","hads . controlling for depression while assessing\n","anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming\n","in the majority of recent work . considering many\n","previous studies have investigated the influence\n","of depression on cognition in pd without\n","accounting for the presence of anxiety and the\n","inconsistent findings reported to date , we\n","recommend that future research should try to\n","disentangle the influence of anxiety versus\n","depression on cognitive impairments in pd .\n","considering the growing number of clinical trials\n","for treating depression , there are few if any for\n","the treatment of anxiety in pd . anxiety is a key\n","contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and\n","greatly requires better treatment options .\n","moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a\n","key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is\n","also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 ,\n","53 ] . future research should examine the link\n","between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in\n","order to determine whether treating anxiety might\n","be a potential therapy for improving fog
